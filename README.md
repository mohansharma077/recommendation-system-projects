 Here's a revised table summarizing the algorithms and models used in recommendation systems::

| Algorithm/Model | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Collaborative Filtering | Recommends items based on the preferences of users with similar interests using user-item interaction data.|
| Content-Based Filtering | Recommends items based on a user's past preferences and analyzes item features like color, style, and brand.|
| Hybrid Filtering | Combines collaborative and content-based filtering approaches for more accurate and personalized recommendations.|
| Deep Learning Models | Uses CNN and RNN to analyze clothing item images and descriptions to provide personalized recommendations.|
| Matrix Factorization | Uses algorithms like SVD and ALS to predict missing values in user-item interaction data and generate recommendations.|
